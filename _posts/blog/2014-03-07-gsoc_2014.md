# M-Lab @ Google Summer of Code 2014!

We are proud to announce that the M-Lab has been accepted as a mentoring organization to the [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) a third year in a row.

<!--more-->

The M-Lab Research Consortium is a collaborative effort dedicated to empowering users, researchers, and regulators with open, verifiable data on network performance. The project ideas suggested in our Ideas Page ([http://www.measurementlab.net/page/gsoc\_2014]({{ site.baseurl }}/page/gsoc_2014/)) offer Summer of Code students the opportunity to make a difference on a global project, working with eminent network researchers and engineers to make production-quality open measurement a reality.

We are highly encouraging any interested students that would like to apply for the M-Lab related project to familiarize with the mlab-ns infrastructure, read the design document, look at the code and ask any questions on the gsoc2014 mailing list. (Links to the mlab-ns documents and to the mailing list are in the [Ideas Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/page/gsoc_2014/).)

Please also remember, that the [Ideas Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/page/gsoc_2014/) is just a starting point and the project performed during the summer might differ from the original idea. Do not hesitate to apply with the brilliant project proposals, because at the end we will evaluate the possible benefits for the M-Lab. From the other hand please take into consideration, that most of the deliverables must be completed by the end of the summer.

In order to help you in being accepted by the M-Lab, we would like to share some helpful tips and advice for students: <http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html>
