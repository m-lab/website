Over 40 participants from academia and industry gathered to _“Measure All the Frights”_, exploring and comparing data from our projects over the eight-hour hackathon. Each host organization suggested potential projects to participants in advance, and those who planned to attend formed teams via Discord or in person to select a project or propose their own ideas. Teams worked on a variety of projects, including:

- Aggregating and visualizing metrics across multiple platforms/datasets
- Analyzing and visualizing internet censorship data
- Examining encrypted client hello (ECH) blocking
- Examining TLS certificate diversity across countries/networks
- Exploring aggregated country level internet performance data
- Reproducing and extending key results from a recent study on web centralization
- Comparing IPv4 versus IPv6 performance

The event concluded with teams presenting their findings to the group. The [**hackathon GitHub repository**](https://github.com/m-lab/open-measurement-hackathon) lists the projects that teams worked on at the event as well as code, presentations, images, etc. that participants shared with the hackathon organizers. 

We’re grateful for everyone who brought their energy and ideas to the IMC 2025 hackathon. We enjoyed meeting you, talking about your research, and appreciate your interest in our open source and open data projects! Thanks as well to [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/) for sponsoring the venue, beverages, and dinner for those who attended.
