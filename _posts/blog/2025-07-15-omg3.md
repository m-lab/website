On June 25, 2025, the Open Measurement Gathering (OMG) held a public event, “*Open Measurement Gathering AMA”,* featuring [Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org/), [IODA](https://ioda.live), [OONI](https://ooni.org/), and [Measurement Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net/). <!--more-->
This was a chance for the OMG group to share project updates, future plans, and gather questions and feedback from the Internet freedom community. Each measurement group presented for 30 minutes followed by Q&A. 

This public virtual event was inspired by the past two OMG convenings (public [reports 1](https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/open-measurement-gathering-1-public-report/) and [2](https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/open-measurement-gathering-2/)) at which OMG groups have shared exciting updates to their platforms, tools, and/or datasets before sharing with the broader Internet freedom community. For the third OMG convening, the groups decided to share previewing updates publicly to encourage community feedback. 

During the event, OMG groups gathered feedback and answered questions from the Internet freedom community directly. 

Detailed summaries of the presentations and Key Community Questions can be found in the OMG3 public [report]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/OMG3_report_July2025.pdf)

You can also watch the presentations and listen to the full Q&A for each session. Links to each group’s presentation:

The OMG AMA event was especially intended  for advocacy organizations, digital rights researchers, anti-censorship tool developers, journalists, lawyers, activists, policy makers, and funders. At its peak, we had about 60 folks joining us from around the world. The OMG groups truly appreciate those who could attend, and we hope to host more joint events in the future!
