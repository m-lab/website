How can M-Lab’s data and platform be used to improve the experience of the Internet for the end user?

Measurement Lab is seeking three Research Fellows to expand Internet performance
research beyond the measurement and optimization for bandwidth. Fellows will
utilize M-Lab’s longitudinal, open dataset and/or platform to identify
under-recognized Internet performance metrics that can be used to improve end
user performance.<!--more-->

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Relation between QoE and network metrics like bandwidth/latency/loss
* Novel metrics that can be computed on existing NDT data
* New measurements/experiments that could be deployed on M-Lab to diagnose
  network bottlenecks
* Characterizing paths measured by M-Lab clients; stability of paths, relation
  to paths of interest (eg., paths to content) or network characterization
* Proposals for new experiments to be hosted on the M-Lab platform
* Identification of biases in M-Lab data
* Implementing ideas introduced during [M-Lab’s Community Call on Latency,
  Bufferbloat and Responsiveness](https://youtu.be/GW5C24YKAh8) and/or the [IAB workshop on Network Quality](https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/network-quality/)

Each fellow will be awarded 30,000 USD and will be responsible for documenting
the process and outcome of their research as well as sharing their work at a
workshop at the end of the fellowship. The fellowship will begin in January 2022
and complete in May 2022. The M-Lab team will provide data analysis support,
research guidance and community networking opportunities.

To apply please provide a two page description of the research project including
a brief timeline and summary of the applicant’s experience & background.
Applications will be reviewed for feasibility of the project plan,
qualifications of the researcher and demonstrated understanding and relevance to
the stated goals of the fellowship. Applications can be sent to
apply@measurementlab.net.

The M-Lab Research Fellowship is made possible by the generous support of [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/).
