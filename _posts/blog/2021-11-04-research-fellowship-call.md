How can M-Lab’s data and platform be used to improve the experience of the
Internet for the end user?

Measurement Lab is seeking three Research Fellows to expand Internet performance
research beyond the measurement and optimization for bandwidth. Fellows will
utilize M-Lab’s longitudinal, open dataset and/or platform to identify
under-recognized Internet performance metrics that can be used to improve end
user performance.<!--more-->

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Relation between QoE and network metrics like bandwidth/latency/loss
* Novel metrics that can be computed on existing NDT data
* New measurements/experiments that could be deployed on M-Lab to diagnose
  network bottlenecks
* Characterizing paths measured by M-Lab clients; stability of paths, relation
  to paths of interest (eg., paths to content) or network characterization
* Proposals for new experiments to be hosted on the M-Lab platform
* Identification of biases in M-Lab data
* Implementing ideas introduced during [M-Lab’s Community Call on Latency,
  Bufferbloat and Responsiveness](https://youtu.be/GW5C24YKAh8) and/or the [IAB workshop on Network Quality](https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/network-quality/)

Eligibility:

Students, post docs and independent researchers are welcome to apply.

Important dates:

Proposal due: December 6, 2021
Fellowship start: January 1, 2022
Mid-fellowship progress check-in: March 15, 2022
Fellowship end: May 30, 2022

To apply please provide: 

1. a two page (12pt single space) description of the research project, including
   a brief timeline for completing the work,
2. the applicant’s CV
3. a brief summary of the applicant’s experience & background.

Applications will be reviewed for feasibility of the project plan,
qualifications of the researcher and demonstrated understanding and relevance to
the stated goals of the fellowship.

**Applications should be sent to
[apply@measurementlab.net](mailto:apply@measurementlab.net) by December 6, 2021
23:59 in the applicant's local time zone.**
