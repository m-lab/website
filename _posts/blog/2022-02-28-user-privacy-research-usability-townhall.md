Presentation on the benefits and challenges of M-Lab’s collection of IP addresses and feedback solicitation for potential alternatives <!--more-->

## Description
As an open, crowd-sourced dataset, M-Lab aims to protect the privacy of users who submit their data while also not limiting researchers’ ability to draw meaningful conclusions. We currently collect the client’s IP address as a means of identifying each individual data point, but are considering alternatives that could potentially improve the elusive equilibrium of privacy and usability. While we are in the Design Phase, the M-Lab team would like to consult with the users of our data, to better understand what the requirements of this effort ought to include. More specifically, we will ask: what do you use the IP address for when using the data? How well would the proposed alternatives work for these use cases? 

If you can’t make it, but want to provide feedback, the session will be recorded. If you can attend though, please do, so we can engage in an active group dialogue as much as possible.
