Are you new to M-Lab data? Do you have questions about how to use it or how it can fit into your research? <!--more-->

## About

Starting June 22, 2023 M-Lab will begin to host community “office hours” on the third Thursday of every month at 11:00 AM EDT. The purpose of these calls are to: 
* Provide hands-on guidance to community members who are new to using M-Lab data. 
* Learn about what kinds of M-Lab research users are interested in and solicit feedback about how we can make it easier.
* Foster idea exchange and potential collaborations within the M-Lab community.

## Notes 
* Both tactical (e.g. “How do I write this query?”) and theoretical  (e.g. “How should I shape my research question?”) questions are welcome.
* As we begin these office hours **we are limiting each session to five participants** to ensure focused time for each person that joins. If more people are interested than spots available, we’ll add more sessions!
* While these sessions will prioritize community members who are just getting started with M-Lab data, more advanced users are welcome to express interest via the sign-up form (just mention it in the notes). If there is enough interest we’ll consider adding other formats.
* If you are interested, but the time does not work for you, fill out the sign-up form and let us know in the notes.
