## New Director 
After an intensive search throughout the summer of 2022 which included many highly qualified candidates, we are pleased to announce Katherine Townsend as our Director. Katherine will use her background in open data, technology in the public interest, and policy to define and implement the strategic vision for M-Lab’s impact on the future of the Internet. Our former Director Lai Yi Ohlsen, who joined the project in 2019, will continue to contribute in her new role as our Lead Data Scientist. 

We are so excited to have Katherine on board and we can't wait for you to meet her. Thank you also to everyone who showed interest in working with M-Lab and for taking the time to apply. We hope to work with you in the future.
