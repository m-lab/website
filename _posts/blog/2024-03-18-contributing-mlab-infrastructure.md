We've added a new, flexible set of options to expand and diversify our global fleet of measurement vantage points.

## Motivations

Since M-Lab was founded in 2008, our mission has been to measure the Internet, save the data and make it universally accessible and useful. As the Internet evolves, we are committed to producing data and tools that reflect these evolutions. Our platform, a global fleet of virtual and physical servers, is a fundamental part of how we accomplish this. 

In 2022, we announced our initiative [M-Lab to the Cloud](https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/2022-mlab-to-the-cloud/), our effort to expand our presence in cloud networks. Since that announcement, 35% of our traffic is directed to virtual servers.

As a continuation of those efforts, we've added a new, flexible set of options for contributing to M-Lab's infrastructure.**Our goal is to expand and diversify our platform to include more user-relevant pathways.**

## A new, flexible set of options

New vantage points can be managed by M-Lab or managed by their host. They can be virtual or physical, and scaled to support either a full site or a minimal site. All options can be placed in “on-net” or “off-net” networks, or in other words, located in edge, access or interconnection points.
