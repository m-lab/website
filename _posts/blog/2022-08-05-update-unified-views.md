Monday August 15th we will be updating the NDT unified views to provide
researchers with access to the row filter logic used to exclude rows that are
not believed to be representative measurements of network performance. This
change enables interested researchers to better understand MLab’s data filtering
and to easily craft alternate filters to verify our assumptions, or to filter
data to address questions other than network throughput.
<!--more-->

The “nofilter” versions of the unified views compute and expose all of the
filtering criteria columns, but do not perform filtering of the data.

The new unified views are also faster, but there are still opportunities for
further improvement.

## Changes to the schema

The schema for the new unified views are forward compatible with the current
production views. Existing queries using fully supported features (i.e. no
fields starting with underscore) should run without modification.

The new unified views also expose additional metadata, including implementation
details for the client, server, parser and wire protocol; locations of raw data,
and in some cases, pointers to the source code. Documentation of this new meta
data will be released in the coming months.

## Changes to the data

The new unified download view has new default row filter logic that does not
exclude flows with non-network bottlenecks, such as CPU or buffering limits at
the client. The old unified_download view excluded flows that did not exhibit
any network congestion feedback, such as packet loss or queuing delay, because
without feedback their performance was determined by something other than the
network. Dave Clark pointed out that this introduces a sample bias against
faster networks[1].

To improve transparency, we also introduce "nofilter" versions of the unified
views which expose the multiple row filtering criteria. We describe these in
more detail below.

This release does not change any of the values for a.MeanThroughputMbps or other
data values, and only increases the number of rows, i.e. tests considered to be
valid.

## Prereleases

Prerelease versions of the new unified views are available for testing.
Researchers using non-standard columns, custom unified views, or who are
concerned about changes to the data are encouraged to test with the prototype
unified views. See: [Release notes for new prototype unified views][prototype]

[prototype]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WvwEcaD6hVtI6ZcpoIHR8SnaTnfX8Pn03QZBJE15-nU/

The simpleset test is to edit `FROM` lines and replace:

* `measurement-lab.ndt.unified_downloads` with `mlab-collaboration.mm_preproduction.unified_downloads`

then, your queries should just run.

## Comparing the Data across changes

The nofilter versions of the unified views provide the columns IsValidBest and
IsValid2021, which are the new and old row selection predicates, respectively.
These can be used to replicate legacy queries or to implement differential
queries. For example:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT (*) AS TotalRows,
  COUNTIF (IsValidBest) AS ValidBestRows,
  COUNTIF (IsValid2021) AS Valid2021Rows,
  COUNTIF (IsValidBest != IsValid2021) AS DeltaRows
FROM
  `mlab-collaboration.mm_preproduction.unified_downloads_nofilter` -- before Aug 15th
  -- `measuremement-lab.ndt.unified_downloads_nofilter` -- after Aug 15th
WHERE
  date = '2022-02-15'
  AND (IsValidBest OR IsValid2021)
```

Note that IsValid2021 is a reconstruction of the production unified views as of
early 2022. The reconstruction matches very closely: averaging within 1 row
per day for the first 12+ years of the project. (Mismatches are most likely
corner cases, such as tests that straddle midnight). In 2022 we started testing
NDT in Google Cloud, and have since discovered that the 2021 production views
inappropriately exclude some NDT tests from GCP because the tests used RFC1918
addresses (net 10/8, etc). This bug has not been reconstructed in IsValid2021,
but only affects a small sample of data from virtual servers running in canary
mode. The new isValidBest is correct for this data.

## Upcoming work

Since the new views are backwards compatible with the old views, the old
documentation is still technically correct, but does not describe how to make
use of the new filter logic or improved metadata. Expect this documentation to
be added in the coming months.
