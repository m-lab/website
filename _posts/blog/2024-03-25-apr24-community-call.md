## Metrics for Measuring Your Internet's Quality

In February 2024 we introduced our latest research intiative Internet Quality Barometer (IQB), which aims to define Internet quality beyond “speed” for use by high-level decision makers. As part of IQB, M-Lab is taking inventory of the metrics and tools available today to test an individual's Internet quality and consider how they can be used in aggregate and at scale to inform public policy and planning processes.

The following initiatives each take a novel approach to measuring the defining characteristics of a user's experience and distilling what Internet quality means on an individual, user basis.

* [Quality of Outcome (QoO)](https://www.understandinglatency.com/knowledge-base/quality-of-outcome-qoo) and [Quality Attenuation (QED)](https://domos.ai/blog/introducing-quality-attenuation-do-isps-deliver-what-their-users-need), presented by Bjørn Ivar Teigen, Head of Research at Domos AI and organizer of the Understanding Latency Webinar Series
* [Responsiveness](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness-00.html), presented by Will Hawkins, Assistant Professor at University of Cincinnati
* [Aggregated Internet Measurement (AIM)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/aim-database-for-internet-quality), presented by David Tuber, Product Manager at Cloudflare

Join us to learn more about these efforts and consider how they could, if collected at scale, be aggregated and used to assess the quality and gaps of a region's Internet quality.
