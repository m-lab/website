**The Open Measurement Gatherings**  
From 2024 to 2025, [Measurement Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net/), [Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org/), [IODA](https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/), and [OONI](https://ooni.org/) organized four convenings called the Open Measurement Gatherings (OMG). The intention of these convenings was to build understanding, trust, and collaboration across open Internet measurement groups and this initiative was made possible with the support of the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/) (OTF).

From September 8-12, 2025, the Open Measurement Groups groups gathered in Estoril, Portugal for the [fourth convening of the two-year program]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/OMG4_final_report.pdf).<!--more-->

**Open Measurement Village**   
From Sept 8-10, 2025, OMG groups hosted an Open Measurement Village at the [Global Gathering](https://gathering.digitalrights.community/) (GG). At the Village, OMG groups took turns hosting a booth, circle discussions, and a game called “Are You My Measurement Tool?” to help compare the use cases and data of each OMG group’s measurement tool. Balancing innovation in Internet measurement with accessibility is a key challenge that came up throughout the Global Gathering. Open measurement groups must keep up with increasingly sophisticated Internet interference while educating the non-technical community.

**New OMG User Guide**  
Based on the feedback from the GG community, the OMG groups created the [OMG User Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/OMG4_User_Guide.pdf) as a public resource to help users determine which measurement tool they should use or how to compare data from OMG groups.

**OMG 4**   
The OMG groups remained in Estoril from September 11-12 to reflect on community feedback and the previous OMG convenings, share updates, and strategize on how to continue the momentum to deepen collaboration following the completion of the OTF-funded program. OMG groups face shared challenges; to counter those challenges we need to increase coordination, and to continue the work the open measurement groups must become sustainable. 

**Impact of the OMG Convenings**   
The OMG convenings deepened mutual understanding among the groups about each platform, tools, data pipelines, and users. Most importantly though, these convenings deepened the interpersonal relationships across OMG groups and built trust so that OMG groups can hold joint public events, preview upcoming changes, solve problems together, and strategize for the future of open measurement to meet a moment of unprecedented challenges. 

These convenings developed a default habit to collaborate, incorporate data across groups, and build collective awareness of each group with our users. Going forward, the OMG groups have several actionable, short and long term plans to continue collaboration. Despite reduced resources, open measurement matters now more than ever given current global trends in policy and technology.
