As of March 18th, access procedures for M-Lab’s archival data will change.<!--more-->

## What’s Changing

M-Lab archival data, the raw data archived in Cloud Storage, will continue to be openly accessible, but will be stored in a more resource efficient way. This does not impact access to M-Lab’s data published in BigQuery.

## What You Need to Do

With this change, we are introducing a new Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA) for M-Lab’s Archival data. This step helps us ensure responsible use of our data resources and better understand data usage needs and patterns.

To continue to access M-Lab’s archival data, you will need to accept the Agreement through the [AUA form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDGsEqfE3Lh3qtRSMy621O_bzBMZtnrw5sDgR42tGWpymJ2w/viewform). The complete Acceptable Use Policy can be found on our [Archival Data page]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/archival-data).

## Connect With Us

If you have used or are interested in using the archival data and are impacted by this change, feel free to connect with us at [support@measurementlab.net](mailto:support@measurementlab.net). We want to know more about your use case and understand how we can best support your research.
