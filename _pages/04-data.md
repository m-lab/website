# About M-Lab's Data

M-Lab publishes its data in two different forms:

-  Google Cloud Storage (raw files)
   -   M-Lab publishes raw output from its measurement tools on Google Cloud Storage as file archives.
   -   See the [M-Lab Google Cloud Storage documentation](/data/gcs) for more information.

-  Google BigQuery (SQL queryable)
   - M-Lab parses data for a subset of its tools and publishes the data on BigQuery, so that users can run SQL queries over the data.
   - See the [M-Lab BigQuery QuickStart](/data/bq/quickstart) for more information.

There is typically at least a 24-hour delay between data collection and data publication.
