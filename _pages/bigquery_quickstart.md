# BigQuery QuickStart

## Configuring Access to M-Lab Data

To search M-Lab's data using BigQuery, follow these quick steps to get started:

### Step 1. Configure Google Cloud Platform Console Project

Create a project, and enable billing in [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.developers.google.com/){:target="_blank"} (or use an existing project with billing enabled).

You will **not** be charged for queries against tables in the M-Lab data set. M-Lab is committed to open data, and offering our data free of charge is part of that commitment.

### Step 2. Configure M-Lab Table Access

Join the [M-Lab Discuss group](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/#%21forum/discuss){:target="_blank"} with the same account you used to create your Google Cloud Platform Console project. Joining this group enables your account so that you can make queries against M-Lab's BigQuery tables.

### Using a Service Account

If you are querying BigQuery via a service account (e.g., @developer.gserviceaccount.com) that cannot join the M-Lab Discuss group, please email [support@measurementlab.net](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) so that we can enable your account manually.

## BigQuery Web Interface

BigQuery offers a web interface so that you can query M-Lab BigQuery data from your browser. To query from the web interface, go to:

[https://bigquery.cloud.google.com](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com){:target="_blank"}

Try the following query as an example:

~~~sql
#standardSQL
-- Calculate how many NDT tests were performed per day since M-Lab began.

SELECT
  partition_date AS day,
  COUNT(test_id) AS num_tests
FROM `measurement-lab.release.ndt_all`
  GROUP BY
    day
  ORDER BY
    day ASC;
~~~

## BigQuery Tools in the Google Cloud SDK

You may also run queries at the command line using BigQuery tools in the Google Cloud SDK.

Download and install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/){:target="_blank"} using the installation and Quick Start instructions for your operating system.

After installation, authentication, and restarting your terminal, BigQuery's command-line tools are available in your shell. Note additional options such as specifying output format are available in the BigQuery command-line tools.

Try the following query as an example:

~~~shell
$ bq --format=csv query -n 900000 "
#standardSQL
-- Calculate how many NDT tests were performed per day since M-Lab began.
SELECT
  partition_date AS day,
  COUNT(test_id) AS num_tests
FROM `measurement-lab.release.ndt_all`
 
GROUP BY
  day
ORDER BY
  day ASC;" > output.csv
~~~

If you are new to BigQuery, we suggest that you next consult the following resources:

* [BigQuery Examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/bq/examples)
* [BigQuery Schema]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/bq/schema)
* [Google's BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery){:target="_blank"}
* [Querying Date Partitioned Tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables){:target="_blank"}
* [Google's bq Command-Line Tool Quickstart documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/bq-command-line-tool-quickstart){:target="_blank"}

## BigQuery API

Given the resources and expertise, you can develop your own application that uses M-Lab data. To learn more about building a custom application, refer to the [Google Cloud Platform Console documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/){:target="_blank"}

**Telescope** is an example of an application that M-Lab developed that uses the BigQuery Python API to download M-Lab data. Telescope is available from M-Lab on [Github](https://github.com/m-lab/telescope){:target="_blank"}.
