# BigQuery Schema

## Background

* Each M-Lab tool consists of a **client** and a **server**.
* Whenever an M-Lab user starts a test, the client and server interact to measure different aspects of that user's connection.
* A single user request triggers one or more **tests** (e.g., client-to-server test, server-to-client test).
* For each test, a server collects a **log** and the test can be uniquely identified by its log filename.

## BigQuery Tables

M-Lab publishes data for each M-Lab project in its own BigQuery table:

* `plx.google:m_lab.ndt.all`
* `plx.google:m_lab.npad.all`
* `plx.google:m_lab.sidestream.all`
* `plx.google:m_lab.paris_traceroute.all`

### Legacy Tables

M-Lab also publishes tables in its legacy, deprecated per-month format.

* `plx.google:m_lab.YYYY_MM.all` (*deprecated*)

For example, data for March 2016 is published at:

* `plx.google:m_lab.2016_03.all` (*deprecated*)

M-Lab continues to support these tables, but urges clients to move to the new per-project tables, which yield substantially improved performance. See the [Legacy Migration Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/bq/legacymigration) for details.

## Schema Fields

All M-Lab data shares the same data schema in BigQuery. The fields are described in the table below:

| Field name                                           |     Type     |  Description                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------|:------------:|:------------------------------------------|
| `test_id`                                           |  `string`    |  ID of the test. It represents the filename of the log that contains the data generated during the test (e.g. `20090819T02:01:04.507508000Z_189.6.232.77:3859.c2s_snaplog.gz`). |

| `connection_spec.server_af`                         |  `integer`   |  Address family of the server's IP address. (This field is **optional**. It's preferable to use `web100_log_entry.connection_spec.local_af`.) |
| `connection_spec.server_hostname`                   |  `string`    |  Server's hostname. (This field is **optional**.) |
| `connection_spec.server_kernel_version`             |  `string`    |  Server's kernel version. (This field is **optional**.) |
| `connection_spec.client_ip `                        |  `string`    |  IP address of the user's client. (This field is **optional**. It's preferable to use `web100_log_entry.connection_spec.remote_ip`.) |
| `connection_spec.client_af`                         |  `integer`   |  Address family of the client's IP address. (This field is **optional**.) |

| `connection_spec.client_kernel_version`             |  `string`    |  Client's kernel version. (This field is **optional**.) |
| `connection_spec.client_version`                    |  `string`    |  Client's version. (This field is **optional**.) |
| `connection_spec.client_geolocation.continent_code` |  `string`    |  Geolocation fields extracted from open dataset created by MaxMind and available at [www.maxmind.com](https://www.maxmind.com). (These fields are **optional**.) |
| `connection_spec.client_geolocation.country_code`   |  `string`    |   |

| `connection_spec.server_geolocation.city`           |  `string`    |   |
| `connection_spec.server_geolocation.area_code`      |  `integer`   |   |
| `connection_spec.server_geolocation.postal_code`    |  `string`    |   |

| `web100_log_entry.version`                          |  `string`    |  Web100 kernel patch version running on the server (as defined in `/proc/web100/header`). |
| `web100_log_entry.log_time`                         |  `integer`   |  Timestamp of when the Web100 log was created (in seconds since Unix epoch).<br><br>For NDT and NPAD, this is derived by calling the [`web100_get_log_time()`](https://github.com/web100/web100-userland/blob/master/lib/web100.h) function on the web100 log file.<br><br>For SideStream, this is the value of the `PollTime` field in web100 ASCII log. |
| `web100_log_entry.connection_spec.local_ip`         |  `string`    |  IP address of the M-Lab server, as logged in the Web100 log. |
| `web100_log_entry.connection_spec.local_af`         |  `integer`   |  Address family of the server's IP address, as logged in the Web100 log.  |
| `web100_log_entry.connection_spec.local_port`       |  `integer`   |  Port of the M-Lab server (in host-byte-order), as logged in the Web100 log. |
| `web100_log_entry.connection_spec.remote_ip`        |  `string`    |  IP address of the user's client, as logged in the Web100 log. |
| `web100_log_entry.connection_spec.remote_port`      |  `integer`   |  Port of the user's client (in host-byte-order), as logged in the Web100 log. |
| `web100_log_entry.snap.[web100_var_name]`, where `web100_var_name` is the name of a Web100 variable, as defined in [tcp-kis.txt][1] (field `VariableName`). |  See Web100 types |  [tcp-kis.txt][1] defines 150 Web100 variables. For example, `web100_log_entry.snap.MinRTT` represents the minimum sampled Round Trip Time. |
| `web100_log_entry.snap.StartTimeStamp`              |  `integer`   |  Time at which the test's TCP connection was established, in microseconds since UNIX epoch. This variable is a special case, as it contradicts [tcp-kis.txt][1]. tcp-kis.txt defines the field as a 32-bit integer, but remaps two distinct 32-bit integers into this single name, which is not possible for a 32-bit value. To work around this bug in tcp-kis and provide microsecond precision, this field is a 64-bit integer in the BigQuery dataset. |
| `paris_traceroute_hop.protocol`                     |  `integer`   |  Protocol used to generate the paris-traceroute trace.<br>UDP = `0`<br>TCP = `1`<br>ICMP = `2` |
| `paris_traceroute_hop.src_ip`                       |  `string`    |  The IP address of the start of the hop. |
| `paris_traceroute_hop.src_af`                       |  `integer`   |  The address family used to connect to `src_ip`.<br>AF_INET = `2`<br>AF_INET6 = `10` |
| `paris_traceroute_hop.src_hostname`                 |  `string`    |  The hostname of the start of the hop. This may be the same as `src_ip` if the hostname could not be resolved. |
| `paris_traceroute_hop.dest_ip`                      |  `string`    |  The IP address of the end of the hop. |
| `paris_traceroute_hop.dest_af`                      |  `integer`   |  The address family used to connect to `dest_ip`.<br>AF_INET = `2`<br>AF_INET6 = `10`. |
| `paris_traceroute_hop.dest_hostname`                |  `string`    |  The hostname of the end of the hop. This may be the same as `dest_ip` if the hostname could not be resolved. |
| `paris_traceroute_hop.rtt`                          |  `float`     |  The RTT measured from `connection_spec.server_ip` to `paris_traceroute_hop.dest_ip`. |

### Deprecated Fields

The following fields are deprecated and no longer have meaning in the dataset.

* `type`
* `project`
* `web100_log_entry.is_last_entry`
* `web100_log_entry.group_name`

### Equivalent BigQuery and Web100 Field Types

[tcp-kis.txt][1] defines each Web100 variable with a specific [SNMP type][2]. This table shows how to map each SNMP type to a BigQuery type.

| BigQuery Type |  Corresponding SNMP Type |
| ------------- | -------------------------|
| `integer`     |  `Integer32`, `Integer`, `INTEGER`, `Gauge32`, `ZeroBasedCounter32`, `Unsigned32`, `Unsigned16`, `Counter32`, `ZeroBasedCounter64` |
| `string`      |  `Ip_Address`            |
| `bool`        |  `TruthValue`            |
