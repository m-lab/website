# Learning Resources


## Office Hours
### About
M-Lab hosts community “office hours” on the third Thursday of every month at 11:00 AM EDT. The purpose of these calls are to:

* Provide hands-on guidance to community members who are new to using M-Lab data.
* Learn about what kinds of M-Lab research users are interested in and solicit feedback about how we can make it easier.
* Foster idea exchange and potential collaborations within the M-Lab community.


### You might conisder attending office hours if...
* You have a tactical question (e.g. "How do I write this query?") or a theoretical question (e.g. “How should I shape my research question?”).
* You are new to using M-Lab data and want more about best practices for its use. 
* You are curious abuot how other's are using M-Lab data and want to share your own work as well. 

### Details
* **Each session is limited to five participants** to ensure focused time for each person that joins. (If more people are interested than spots available, we’ll add more sessions).
* While these sessions prioritize community members who are just getting started with M-Lab data, more advanced users are welcome to express interest via the sign-up form (just mention it in the notes). If there is enough interest we’ll consider adding other formats.
* If you are interested, but the time does not work for you, fill out the sign-up form and let us know in the notes.
