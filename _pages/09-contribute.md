# Supporting or Contributing to M-Lab
{:.no_toc}

M-Lab welcomes the participation of individuals and researchers, as well as companies, organizations, and other institutions, that would like to help expand the platform and ensure its growth and success.

## Develop a Test

Researchers developing and maintaining open source network measurement tests may apply to host a new test on M-Lab. If your project fits within M-Lab's guidelines and principles, we invite you to [email us about M-Lab hosting](mailto:suppport@measurementlab.net).

Please review the documents below before applying:

* [M-Lab Conceptual & Technical Scope & Related Policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/mlab-scope/)
* [M-Lab Memorandum of Understanding for Experiment Developers]({{ site.baseurl }}/experimenter-mou/)
* [M-Lab Experiment Developer Responsibilities, Requirements, and Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/experimenter-requirements-guidelines/)

## Use an M-Lab Test in Your Website or Application

M-Lab's open source tests can be added to your website, mobile application, or other software, providing a service to your users and allowing M-Lab to reach more people and generate more data. If you are considering building an M-Lab test into your website or application, you should be familiar with M-Lab's [Privacy]({{ site.basurl }}/privacy) and [Acceptable Use]({{ site.baseurl }}/aup) policies.

You can find out more information:

* In our [Developers Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/develop).
* In our support answer: [How can I add an M-Lab test to my website, mobile app, or other software?](https://support.measurementlab.net/help/en-us/5-supporting-or-contributing-to-m-lab/24-how-can-i-add-an-m-lab-test-to-my-website-app-or-other-software), in our [data documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs)

## Host or Sponsor M-Lab Measurement Sites

It is now easier than ever to contribute to the Measurement Lab platform.  The process is almost entirely automated and any reasonably modern, high performance and well connected physical or virtual server can be added to M-Lab's fleet.

Review M-Lab's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.measurementlab.net/aup/), [Privacy Policy](https://www.measurementlab.net/privacy/), and the technical and operational requirements at the top of [Setting up a host-managed server](https://github.com/m-lab/autonode/wiki/Host%E2%80%90managed-Deployments).

Register your organization by completing the online [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejtmZJrW8BPuuhjG4FlGm0fFmN3cW6onvLsCxkd3UnECVd9Q/viewform?usp=dialog).   M-Lab will review your submission and confirm that you qualify to become an M-Lab site host.  Under some circumstances we may suggest drafting a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), for example if your contribute more than 10 servers or are exceptional in some other way.   Once you qualify, M-Lab will provide you with an API key and other information necessary to build and configure measurement servers.

All contributions are considered tax-deductible donations to Code for Science & Society, M-Labâ€™s nonprofit fiscal sponsor. To learn more, contact us at [hello@measurementlab.net](mailto:hello@measurementlab.net).    [@@@ International contributors? Add a question about tax information to the host form?]

Other methods for deploying M-Lab servers are gradually being phased out. 

## Analyze and Visualize M-Lab Data

M-Lab welcomes researchers who want to dig into the M-Lab data, providing documentation and best-effort email support. If you are interested in working with M-Lab data in your research, please review our [data documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data) to help get you started, and [contact us](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) with any questions. We also suggest that you join our [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss){:target="_blank"} for news and announcements.

If you have experience in web or application development, data analysis, or visualization, you may be interested in working with M-Lab's tests, data, and analysis tools, all of which are open source and openly licensed.
