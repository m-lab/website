# Supporting or Contributing to M-Lab

M-Lab welcomes the participation of individuals researchers and ISPs, as well as
companies, organizations, and other institutions that would like to help expand
the platform and ensure its growth and success.

Note that all M-Lab usage and contributions are subject to M-Lab’s [Acceptable
Use Policy](https://www.measurementlab.net/aup/) and [Privacy
Policy](https://www.measurementlab.net/privacy/). For any contribution of
significant resources, it might be appropriate to draft a Memorandum of
Understanding.

## Develop a Test

Researchers developing and maintaining open source network measurement tests may
apply to host a new test on M-Lab. If your project fits within M-Lab’s
guidelines and principles, we invite you to email us about M-Lab hosting.

Please review these documents below before contacting us:

* [M-Lab Conceptual & Technical Scope & Related Policies](https://www.measurementlab.net/mlab-scope/)
* [M-Lab Experiment Developer Responsibilities, Requirements, and Guidelines](https://www.measurementlab.net/experimenter-requirements-guidelines/)

## Use an M-Lab Test in Your Website or Application

M-Lab’s open source tests can be added to your website, mobile application, or
other software, providing a service to your users and allowing M-Lab to reach
more people and generate more data.  The Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) has been
used by a number of third party websites and application developers, including
Google Search, Speedup America, Fing, and several others.

If you are considering building an M-Lab test into your website or application,
you should be familiar with M-Lab’s
[Privacy](https://www.measurementlab.net/privacy) and [Acceptable
Use](https://www.measurementlab.net/aup) policies.

You can find out more information in our [Developers
Guide](https://www.measurementlab.net/develop) and [data
documentation](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/docs)

## Host or Sponsor an M-Lab Measurement Site

It's easier than ever to contribute to Measurement Lab’s platform. The process
is almost entirely automated, allowing any reasonably modern, high-performance,
and well-connected physical or virtual server to be added to M-Lab's fleet. This
will increase the platform's resilience, diversity, and reach, supporting
M-Lab’s mission.

All contributions are considered tax-deductible donations to Code for Science &
Society, M-Lab’s nonprofit fiscal sponsor. To learn more, contact us at
<hello@measurementlab.net>.

### Host-Managed Deployment

This is the best way for small to medium sized ISPs or other organizations to
contribute M-Lab servers.  We are now accepting new host organizations in a
second pilot phase.

To contribute servers:

* Review M-Lab's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.measurementlab.net/aup/),
  [Privacy Policy](https://www.measurementlab.net/privacy/), and the technical
  and operational requirements at the top of [host-managed](https://www.measurementlab.net/contribute/host-managed/).
* Complete the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejtmZJrW8BPuuhjG4FlGm0fFmN3cW6onvLsCxkd3UnECVd9Q/viewform?usp=dialog). M-Lab will review and contact applicants if approved.
* Under some circumstances we may suggest drafting a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), for example if you contribute more than 10 servers or are exceptional in some other way.

M-Lab will provide successful applicants with an API key and other information
necessary to build and configure measurement servers.

### Jointly Managed Deployment

We are developing a new deployment model suitable for organizations that can
automatically manage a fleet of physical or virtual servers.

If this is a possibility for your organization, please get in touch with us at
[hello@measurementlab.net](mailto:hello@measurementlab.net). We want to ensure
our new deployment model is compatible with existing fleet orchestration
technologies and would love to hear from you.

### Cloud Credits for Virtual Servers

The easiest way to donate infrastructure to M-Lab is by providing cloud credits
from major providers such as **Google Cloud**, **Amazon Web Services**,
**Azure**, **Equinix**, **Linode**, **IBM**, etc.

On average, our fleet's egress load (typically the most expensive cost) is about
**100 Mb/s** per server.  However, our busiest servers can average almost **3
Gb/s**. We can steer measurement traffic to limit the load on any individual
server, allowing us to tune traffic to fit your budget.

This option is ideal for contributors who offer large-scale cloud services, but
are not interested in co-managing their contribution to our fleet.

### Hardware Deployment Managed by M-Lab

The current M-Lab physical fleet consists of bare metal servers with Dell’s
iDRAC remote console and software fully managed by M-Lab.  A minimal deployment
would consist of one server with statically assigned, globally routed /28 or /29
IPv4 prefix and one /64 IPv6 prefix.  The legacy full deployment (4 servers and
a switch) is no longer necessary.

If you are interested in contributing hardware to the M-Lab platform we would be
interested in piloting new server specifications. Please contact us at
[hello@measurementlab.net](mailto:hello@measurementlab.net).

### Interested?

Please fill out our online [infrastructure contribution
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejtmZJrW8BPuuhjG4FlGm0fFmN3cW6onvLsCxkd3UnECVd9Q/viewform?usp=dialog)
and feel free to reach out to <hello@measurementlab.net>.

## **Analyze and Visualize M-Lab Data**

M-Lab welcomes researchers who want to dig into the M-Lab data, providing
documentation and best-effort email support. If you are interested in working
with M-Lab data in your research, please review our [data
documentation](https://www.measurementlab.net/data) to help get you started, and
contact us with any questions. We also suggest that you join our [public mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss)
for news and announcements.  If you have experience in web or application
development, data analysis, or visualization, you may be interested in working
with M-Lab’s tests, data, and analysis tools, all of which are open source and
openly licensed.
