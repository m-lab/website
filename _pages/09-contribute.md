# Supporting or Contributing to M-Lab
{:.no_toc}

M-Lab welcomes the participation of individuals and researchers, as well as companies, organizations, and other institutions, that would like to help expand the platform and ensure its growth and success.

## Develop a Test

Researchers developing and maintaining open source network measurement tests may apply to host a new test on M-Lab. If your project fits within M-Lab's guidelines and principles, we invite you to [email us about M-Lab hosting](mailto:suppport@measurementlab.net).

Please review the documents below before applying:

* [M-Lab Conceptual & Technical Scope & Related Policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/mlab-scope/)
* [M-Lab Memorandum of Understanding for Experiment Developers]({{ site.baseurl }}/experimenter-mou/)
* [M-Lab Experiment Developer Responsibilities, Requirements, and Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/experimenter-requirements-guidelines/)

## Use an M-Lab Test in Your Website or Application

M-Lab's open source tests can be added to your website, mobile application, or other software, providing a service to your users and allowing M-Lab to reach more people and generate more data. If you are considering building an M-Lab test into your website or application, you should be familiar with M-Lab's [Privacy]({{ site.basurl }}/privacy) and [Acceptable Use]({{ site.baseurl }}/aup) policies.

You can find out more information:

* In our [Developers Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/develop).
* In our support answer: [How can I add an M-Lab test to my website, mobile app, or other software?](https://support.measurementlab.net/help/en-us/5-supporting-or-contributing-to-m-lab/24-how-can-i-add-an-m-lab-test-to-my-website-app-or-other-software), in our [data documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs)

## Host or Sponsor an M-Lab Measurement Site

M-Lab supporting partners may contribute or donate resources to provide new measurement points around the world. M-Lab places servers in datacenters where last mile ISPs interconnect with transit to the Internet. At a minimum, sponsoring a measurement point requires a commitment to provide:

* 5U rackspace and power
* a /26 IPv4 block and /64 IPv6 block if available, both globally routed, and statically assigned to M-Lab equipment
* a 1G dedicated, burstable to 10G uplink to a single transit provider
* remote support in coordination with M-Lab for installation and periodic maintenance
* three year commitment to sponsor costs of the above items

If you represent an organization interested in becoming an M-Lab supporting partner, please [contact us](mailto:support@measurementlab.net).

## Analyze and Visualize M-Lab Data

M-Lab welcomes researchers who want to dig into the M-Lab data, providing documentation and best-effort email support. If you are interested in working with M-Lab data in your research, please review our [data documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data) to help get you started, and [contact us](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) with any questions. We also suggest that you join our [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss){:target="_blank"} for news and announcements.

If you have experience in web or application development, data analysis, or visualization, you may be interested in working with M-Lab's tests, data, and analysis tools, all of which are open source and openly licensed.
