# General questions

{% capture accordion_entry_1 %}
Measurement Lab (M-Lab) is the largest open source Internet measurement effort in the world. M-Lab provides performance [tests]({{ site.baseurl }}/tests) for consumers to have an accurate picture of their Internet service, by offering a robust, state-of-the-art server platform that supports diverse measurement needs. The data is aggregated and released in the public domain for policymakers, researchers, and anyone interested in Internet issues.

The graphic below illustrates the relationship between tests run by consumers and M-Lab's data collection.

Right now, people can use tests to measure their broadband speed, analyze application performance, and run diagnostics. The most commonly run test is the Network Diagnostic Test (NDT), which provides metrics such as upload speed, download speed, and round trip time, and as well as other data points that help to understand speed and throughput issues on your connection. To read about all of the tests available on the platform, please visit our tests page.

{% capture accordion_entry_2 %}
**Absolutely not.** M-Lab tests are designed to protect privacy by measuring only synthetic traffic ("fake" traffic generated by a test) between your device and an M-Lab server.

M-Lab collects and publishes all test data, which includes the IP address assigned to your device by your Internet service provider (ISP). However, this **does not** include any information about you as an Internet user, where you browse, or any other personal details.

M-Lab's [privacy and data collection policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy) prohibit the collection of personally-identifiable information and private user traffic.

Internet performance tests may provide different results for a wide variety of reasons. Three of the primary reasons for different results between tests are:

**Differences in the placement of testing servers**
Any performance test -- whether M-Lab's or another -- has two parts. The client - the test running on your computer, and the server -- the location on the Internet where your computer is connecting to complete the test. A test generates data between the client and the server, and measures performance between these two points. The location of these two points is important in terms of understanding the results of a given test.

If the server is located within your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) own network (also knows as the "last mile"), this is referred to as "on-net" measurement. This approach provides insight into the performance of your Internet connection within your ISP, but does not necessarily reflect the full experience of using the Internet, which almost always involves accessing content and services that are hosted somewhere outside of your ISP. Results achieved from "on-net" testing are often higher than those achieved via other methods, since the distance traveled is generally shorter, and the network is entirely controlled by one entity (your ISP).

So-called "off-net" measurements conduct measurements between a test client and a server located outside of your ISP's network. This means that traffic crosses borders between networks, and often travels longer distances. Off-net testing generally produces results that are lower, relative to "on-net" testing.

M-Lab's measurements are always conducted “off-net.” This choice was made to allow M-Lab to measure performance to representative locations where popular Internet content is often hosted, and thus give test users a sense of the performance they could expect when using the Internet.

**Differences in testing methodology**
Different Internet performance tests measure performance of different things in different ways. M-Lab's NDT test attempts to transfer as much data as it can over the course of 10 seconds (both up and down), using a single connection to an M-Lab server. Other popular tests look to transfer as much data as possible across multiple connections to their server at once. Neither are "right" or "wrong," but using a single stream is more likely to help diagnose problems in the network that multiple streams concurrently would likely bypass. [Learn more about M-Lab's NDT methodology](http://www.measurementlab.net/data/).

All NDT data collected by M-Lab is publicly available in both [visualized](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=e9krd11m38onf_) and [raw](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/m-lab/ndt/) forms.

**Changing network conditions and distinct test paths**
The Internet is a dynamic place, and test results reflect that. A test conducted 5 minutes ago may show distinctly different results than a test conducted 20 minutes ago. This can be caused by the test traffic being routed differently. For example, one test might travel over a path with broken router, while another may take a different path. A test run now may be directed to a test server further away than a test run yesterday.

In short, running one test will give you a sense of network conditions at that moment, across the best network path available at that time, to the specific server coordinating the test. But because Internet routing and infrastructure changes dynamically, testing regularly and looking at the data over time is a much more reliable way to gauge representative performance.

{% capture accordion_entry_7 %}
Most M-Lab tests should take less than 60 seconds to complete, so if it's taking longer there may be something wrong.

* Try running the test again. Perhaps a sporadic network issue caused the problem.
* Try running the test from a different location. For example, if it failed at your home, does the test work at a coffee shop?
* If the test doesn't ever start or never completes, is your connection is behind a firewall? This may be the case at some workplaces where the network is actively managed.

If you find that none of the above solves the issue you are experiencing, you can report a bug by emailing [support@measurementlab.net](mailto:support@measurementlab.net).

When reporting a bug, please attempt to share specific information such as:
* Operating system
* Browser name and version
* The name of the test that is not working
* Any error messages you have received

M-Lab support will usually reply within 2 business days. You can also ask other M-Lab users about the issue you are reporting on the [M-Lab Discuss group](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/?fromgroups#%21forum/discuss).

In 2008, [Vint Cerf](http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#vint), one of the "fathers of the Internet," began a series of conversations with Internet researchers to learn more about challenges they faced trying to study Internet performance. Researchers identified several problems, including a lack of widely-deployed servers with ample connectivity to support Internet measurement experiments. They also reported an inability to share large data sets with one another easily.

There also was no public resource to provide aggregate performance data to policymakers, or  consumers interested in understanding their Internet performance over time. As a result of these conversations, M-Lab was founded to help address the core impediments experienced by researchers, and promote at-scale open measurement of the Internet.
{% endcapture }

{% capture accordion_entry_4 %}
The Internet measurement tests running on the M-Lab platform are built and maintained by researchers interested in understanding the Internet and how people experience it. Interested researchers can build their own open source tests and apply to host them with M-Lab. Applications for new tests are reviewed by our operations team and reviewed by our Steering Committee, and if approved they are then deployed on M-Lab's global Internet measurement infrastructure. By making researchers' tests available in this way, and promoting their use by consumer, M-Lab serves both consumers and researchers, as well as regulators and others with longitudinal data that is openly available for analysis.

M-Lab is open to applications from researchers who develop and maintain Open Source network measurement tests that conform to our [goals and support our mission]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute). However, the vast majority of proposed new M-Lab tests are not accepted because of the high bar M-Lab sets for tools we host: we require tests to have fully automatic operation within virtual machines running concurrently on servers distributed globally; and active, client-initiated, off-net network measurement tests looking at full-path performance.

Researchers maintaining the current tools on the M-Lab platform have secured sufficient funding to support their tool's continued development, deployment, and ongoing maintenance throughout the entire lifecycle of the tool. Your decision to deploy and support a particular tool on M-Lab is a commitment to provide substantial resources over a period of years and to an ongoing relationship with the M-Lab operations team.

Applications for new tools are reviewed by the M-Lab Operations team and the M-Lab Steering Committee twice annually. The number of slots for tools running on M-Lab is finite, so we will only consider serious inquiries from researchers working on mature tools that both align with the M-Lab mission and do not significantly overlap with the functionality of existing tools.

If you are interested in deploying a new tool or test on the M-Lab platform, please first read our document outlining [M-Lab's requirements and procedures for accepting new tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/mlab-procedures-new-tools.pdf) on the platform, and then [contact](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) the M-Lab Operations team for more information.
