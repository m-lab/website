# Research Fellow (data science and Internet measurements)

We are seeking a motivated Research Fellow with a background in data science and Internet measurements to join our team and advance the development of the [Internet Quality Barometer (IQB) framework](https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/iqb/). The goal of this role is to develop software components and a prototype interactive tool for the IQB framework. This tool will support researchers in exploring Internet quality and accessibility, and in generating meaningful insights from measurement data. The role also includes analyzing Internet measurement datasets and contributing to research reports and recommendations on methodologies that will guide the ongoing improvement of the IQB framework.



**Duration**: 3-4 months with possibility to extend

**Hours per week**: About 20 hours per week


## Duties & Responsibilities

* Contribute to the development of an open-source software library for IQB methods, including data collection, aggregation, processing, analysis, and visualization.  
* Build a prototype web application (e.g., using Python’s *streamlit* library) to visualize IQB results, facilitate access, and support experimentation.  
* Conduct experiments with IQB framework parametrization (e.g., weights, datasets, thresholds) and analyze results for sensitivity, reliability, and robustness.  
* Perform data analysis using Internet measurement datasets to support IQB evaluations.  
* Contribute to writing research reports summarizing findings and methodological improvements.  
* Collaborate with the IQB development team, advisory committee, community experts, and partner researchers.  
* Integrate feedback to improve the IQB methodology, prototype, and research plan.  
* Participate in ideation and co-creation activities for advancing IQB research.



## Required Skills and Qualifications
