# Research Fellow (data science and Internet measurements)

We are seeking a motivated Research Fellow with a background in data science and Internet measurements to join our team and advance the development of the [Internet Quality Barometer (IQB) framework](https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/iqb/). The goal of this role is to develop software components and a prototype interactive tool for the IQB framework. This tool will support researchers in exploring Internet quality and accessibility, and in generating meaningful insights from measurement data. The role also includes analyzing Internet measurement datasets and contributing to research reports and recommendations on methodologies that will guide the ongoing improvement of the IQB framework.

**Duration**: 3-4 months with possibility to extend

**Hours per week**: About 20 hours per week

**Hourly Rate:** $30.00 to $40.00 USD   

**Location:** Remote (Central Europe / US Eastern working hours)   

**Deadline:** **15 Oct 2025 (first round), applicants will be reviewed on rolling basis** 


## Duties & Responsibilities

* Contribute to the development of an open-source software library for IQB methods, including data collection, aggregation, processing, analysis, and visualization.  
* Build a prototype web application (e.g., using Python’s *streamlit* library) to visualize IQB results, facilitate access, and support experimentation.  
* Conduct experiments with IQB framework parametrization (e.g., weights, datasets, thresholds) and analyze results for sensitivity, reliability, and robustness.  
* Perform data analysis using Internet measurement datasets to support IQB evaluations.  
* Contribute to writing research reports summarizing findings and methodological improvements.  
* Collaborate with the IQB development team, advisory committee, community experts, and partner researchers.  
* Integrate feedback to improve the IQB methodology, prototype, and research plan.  
* Participate in ideation and co-creation activities for advancing IQB research.



## Required Skills and Qualifications

* Strong proficiency in Python (including, Jupyter/Colab, data science, visualization libraries).  
* Proficiency with SQL  
* Solid background in data analysis, visualization, and reporting.  
* Familiarity with Internet measurement protocols and datasets  
* Strong written and verbal communication skills.

## Nice to Have

* Familiarity with Internet speedtest datasets (M-Lab’s NDT, Ookla, Cloudflare)  
* Experience with Python’s streamlit library   
* Experience contributing to or maintaining open-source software projects.  
* Hands-on experience with Google BigQuery.  
* Research experience with a track record of publications or technical reports.

## How to Apply

* [Fill out this application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgJnx-RQ_oyLWev8Pbf6unEdEcjNxGjR4Hl68q7motzKFIqQ/viewform?usp=header) which requires a CV, a motivation statement (written or video) and a work sample (video preferred).   
* **Apply by October 15 for priority review\!** We will review applicants on a rolling basis. 



## About M-Lab 

[Measurement Lab (M-Lab)](https://www.measurementlab.net/about/) is an open Internet measurement platform invested in the improvement of the Internet in the public interest. We collect and publish over 4 million tests per day for open access to help inform policy, advocacy, research, industry and more about how the Internet is performing and evolving over time.    

Our focus areas include internet freedom, censorship measurement, digital divide advocacy, broadband mapping, and more. Our contributor ecosystems include experts in policy, advocacy (at the local, national and international level), public interest technology, software engineering, network engineering and operation, academic research, philanthropy, and more.   

We are an all-remote team and participate in a 4-day work week. We prioritize flexibility and balance to support people to work in a way that they need. We are a fiscally sponsored project of Code for Science & Society
