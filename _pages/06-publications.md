### M-Lab: User Initiated Internet Data for the Research Community
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Measurement Lab (M-Lab) is an open, distributed server platform
on which researchers have deployed measurement tools. Its mission is to measure the Internet, save the data and make it universally accessible and useful. This paper serves as an update on the MLab platform 10+ years after its initial introduction to the research community. Here, we detail the current state of the M-Lab distributed platform, highlights existing measurements/data available on the platform, and describes opportunities for further engagement between the networking research community and the platform.

### Deprecating the TCP Macroscopic Model
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
The TCP Macroscopic Model will be completely obsolete soon. It was a closed form performance model for Van Jacobson’s land- mark congestion control algorithms presented at Sigcomm’88. Ja- cobson88 requires relatively large buffers to function as intended, while Moore’s law is making them uneconomical. BBR-TCP is a break from the past, unconstrained by many of the assumptions and principles defined in Jacobson88. It already out performs Reno and CUBIC TCP over large portions of the Internet, generally without creating queues of the sort needed by earlier congestion control algorithms. It offers the potential to scale better while using less queue buffer space than existing algorithms. Because BBR-TCP is built on an entirely new set of principles, it has the potential to deprecate many things, including the Macro- scopic Model. New research will be required to lay a solid founda- tion for an Internet built on BBR.

### Complementary realities: Public domain Internet measurements in the development of Canada’s universal access policies
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
As access to the Internet has become increasingly essential for social and economic participation, public domain Internet measurements have become indispensable for users to validate quality of service their network operator delivers and for policymakers to identify and address gaps in broadband infrastructure. This article evaluates public domain Internet performance measurements available for assessing the state of connectivity and developing universal access service quality standards in Canada. The analysis suggests that different approaches to Internet measurement represent complementary windows into a complex and fast evolving reality of broadband connectivity. Despite their potential shortcomings, large-scale crowdsourced open data network testing platforms have a central role to play in enabling broadband infrastructure policy coordination across different levels of government, empowerment of consumers, and achievement of universal service objectives for quality of service users experience when accessing the open Internet.

### Estimating Residential Broadband Capacity using Big Data from M-Lab
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Knowing residential broadband capacity profiles across a population is of interest to both consumers and regulators who want to compare or audit performance of various broadband service offerings. Unfortunately, extracting broadband capacity from speed tests in public datasets like M-Lab is challenging because tests are indexed by client IP address which can be dynamic and/or obfuscated by NAT, and variable network conditions can affect measurements. This paper presents the first systematic effort to isolate households and extract their broadband capacity using 63 million speed test measurements recorded over a 12 month period in the M-Lab dataset. We first identify a key parameter, the correlation between measured speed and congestion count for a specific client IP address, as an indicator of whether the IP address represents a single house, or a plurality of houses that may be dynamically sharing addresses or be aggregated behind a NAT. We then validate our approach by comparing to ground truth taken from a few known houses, and at larger scale by checking internal consistency across ISPs and across months. Lastly, we present results that isolate households and estimate their broadband capacity based on measured data, and additionally reveal insights into the prevalence of NAT and variations in service capacity tiers across ISPs.

### The Record Route Option is an Option!
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
The IPv4 Record Route (RR) Option instructs routers to record their IP addresses in a packet. RR is subject to a nine hop limit and, traditionally, inconsistent support from routers. Recent changes in interdomain connectivity—the so-called "flattening Internet"—and new best practices for how routers should handle RR packets suggest that now is a good time to reassess the potential of the RR Option.

### Strategic choice and broadband divergence in the transition to next generation networks: Evidence from Canada and the U.S.
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
This article investigates how infrastructure competition among broadband network infrastructure operators in Canada and the U.S. has influenced their incentives to increase fixed broadband connection speeds and invest in next generation fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) technologies. The evolution of measured broadband speeds since the late 2000s documents growing differences in the incentives of dominant broadband operators to respond to demand for higher speed connectivity by increasing connectivity speeds they deliver to their customers. Dominant network operators in Canada have shown relatively stronger incentives than their counterparts in the U.S. to invest in and increase the capacity of legacy platforms. In the U.S. FTTP deployment incentives have been somewhat stronger, but network operators have been more reluctant to upgrade legacy technologies to deliver higher speeds. Diversity of strategic choices by large operators helps explain increasing regional and local broadband infrastructure gaps within the two countries. A high dividend payout financial strategy and increasing vertical integration appear to enhance the potential for overinvestment and inefficient duplication in legacy platforms by competing infrastructure providers.

### Regulatory Federalism and Broadband Divergence: Implications of Invoking Europe in the Making of Canadian Telecom Policy
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Invocations of Europe are increasingly evident in Canadian debates about wholesale broadband access, consumer protection, network neutrality and basic service policies. While some stakeholders in Canadian debates point to national and local approaches in Europe that appear to have been relatively successful in fostering broadband infrastructure development, others suggest that Europe is lagging behind and Canada should avoid Europe’s purported policy errors.

### Measuring Broadband in Schools
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
The challenges that school administrators face when budgeting for and deploying technology vary widely, as do their approaches to supporting its use within their schools. Measuring and assessing network health is a critical challenge facing public schools as they plan for both today’s and tomorrow’s broadband needs. New America’s Open Technology Institute (OTI) and Education Policy program partnered with the IT staff at Alexandria City Public Schools (ACPS) in Virginia to conduct a pilot study as a first step toward addressing this challenge. The study, Measuring Broadband in Schools, looked at the complexities of understanding network capacity in education institutions, and sought to better understand the challenges of measuring network capacity at the point of use in schools.

### Measuring Latency Variation in the Internet
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
The authors analyse two complementary datasets to quantify the latency variation experienced by Internet end-users: (i) a large-scale active measurement dataset (from the Measurement Lab Network Diagnostic Tool) which shed light on long-term trends and regional differences; and (ii) passive measurement data from an access aggregation link which is used to analyse the edge links closest to the user. The analysis shows that variation in latency is both common and of significant magnitude, with two thirds of samples exceeding 100 ms of variation. The variation is seen within single connections as well as between connections to the same client. The distribution of experienced latency variation is heavy-tailed, with the most affected clients seeing an order of magnitude larger variation than the least affected. In addition, there are large differences between regions, both within and between continents. Despite consistent improvements in throughput, most regions show no reduction in latency variation over time, and in one region it even increases.

### Analysis of Impartial Quality Measurements on Indian Broadband Connections
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Broadband Internet user base is growing at an exponential pace in India. The market pressures are forcing the Internet service providers (ISPs) to sell their service offerings aggressively, resulting in a growing discrepancy between consumer expectations and service offerings from the ISPs. This discrepancy is often evident in experienced vs offered Internet connection service. This study examines the Quality of Service (QoS) variations for Internet connections of the Indian broadband users.

### Measuring broadband performance using M-Lab: Why averages tell a poor tale
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Broadband network performance is multi-faceted: it varies by ISP, by content source, by household connection, and by time-of-day. Daily or monthly averages, as published by content providers such as Netflix and Google, do not convey the full picture. In this paper we leverage M-Lab, the world's largest open measurement platform, to characterize broadband performance across Australian households. Our study delves into millions of data samples collected from 96,882 households over four months, and looks beyond averages to make several interesting observations: 1) There is considerable variation amongst households, in terms of their broadband speeds and variability of network performance within a day and across days, and this information is lost when data is averaged across houses; 2) The fluctuations (even for a specific house) are significant, and can exhibit unexpected patterns, such as wide variations from one day to the next, and some clusters of outliers at certain times of the day. 3) By our experimental results, we conclude that neither aggregating by household nor aggregating by day or by hour is a sound measurement strategy. Moreover, our study sheds new perspectives on broadband evaluation by using M-Lab data, and can inspire future study into the underlying reasons of performance variation.

### Public QoS and Net Neutrality Measurements: Current Status and Challenges Toward Exploitable Results
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
The interest for Quality of Service (QoS) measurements in the Internet has exceeded the boundaries of research laboratories and passed into the public domain. The Internet is treated as a public utility, and users are given the right to access Internet content of their choice at an adequate quality. This coincides with the sustained interest for net neutrality (NN), basic safeguards for which are being taken in countries all over the world. Today, several tools have become available that empower end-users to measure the performance of their Internet connection and detect NN violations. However, the value that end-users obtain with these measurements is still small and the results are not being exploited satisfactorily by regulatory authorities, policy makers, and consumers. In this article, we perform a detailed review of the tools that are currently available for public QoS and NN measurements and explore three challenges that must be met in order to extract more value from the results: (a) Harmonization of measurement methodologies of basic performance parameters (throughput, delay, jitter, and packet loss); (b) the creation of a toolbox for detecting and monitoring NN violations; and (c) the use of a proper sampling plan for producing estimates over population groups.

### Analysis of End-User QoE in Community Networks
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Community networks are a potential model for the Future Internet, where the users form and operate the network instead of a central, commercial entity. Socio-economic studies show that community networks are an excellent model to develop networking infrastructure commons (as common-pool resources or public goods) that promote sustainable development, with greater effects in less developed areas. The performance of parts of community networks has been studied extensively, often focusing on routing protocols or applications on top of community networks. This work focuses on the end-to-end quality of Internet access in community networks, as a validation of the technical applicability of this concept in under-served regions.

### The macroscopic behavior of the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm

ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review; Volume 27 Issue 3, July 1997; Pages 67-82

{:.paper-description}
The authors analyze a performance model for the TCP Congestion Avoidance algorithm. The model predicts the bandwidth of a sustained TCP connection subjected to light to moderate packet losses, such as loss caused by network congestion. It assumes that TCP avoids retransmission timeouts and always has sufficient receiver window and sender data. The model predicts the Congestion Avoidance performance of nearly all TCP implementations under restricted conditions and of TCP with Selective Acknowledgements over a much wider range of Internet conditions.We verify the model through both simulation and live Internet measurements. The simulations test several TCP implementations under a range of loss conditions and in environments with both drop-tail and RED queuing. The model is also compared to live Internet measurements using the TReno diagnostic and real TCP implementations. The authors also present several applications of the model to problems of bandwidth allocation in the Internet. They use the model to analyze networks with multiple congested gateways; this analysis shows strong agreement with prior work in this area. Finally, the authors present several important implications about the behavior of the Internet in the presence of high load from diverse user communities.

### SHLB Coalition AnchorNets 2019 Session
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Staff from Simmons University, Measurement Lab, and Internet2 presented at the Schools Health & Libraries Broadband Coalition's annual AnchorNets conference, October 17, 2019 in Alexandria, Virgina. The session provided an introduction and update to the research project, Measuring Library Broadband Networks, in which partners are working together with public libraries in the United States to measure their broadband networks. The purpose is to better understand how libraries can leverage broadband to better serve their communities’ digital needs. Funded by a grant (award #LG-71-18-0110-18) from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Service (IMLS), the team will work with up to 60 libraries in rural, suburban, and urban communities through May 2020, to gather quantitative and qualitative data using participatory design approaches. The project aims to: understand the broadband speeds and quality of service that public libraries receive; assess how well broadband service and infrastructure are supporting libraries’ communities’ digital needs; understand broadband network usage and capacity, along with additional data that would be useful to public libraries in providing their communities with online software applications and social and technical infrastructure, and increase libraries’ knowledge of networked services and connectivity needs.

### Internet2 Tech Exchange - Bring NDT Back: Measurement Lab Modernizes NDT Server
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
The R&E network community using perfSONAR used to include the Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT), a single stream performance measurement of bulk transport capacity. Many years ago, perfSONAR dropped support for NDT since its dependence on the web100 kernel library required running old, outdated, and hard to secure linux kernels. Measurement Lab (M-Lab) had the same problem, but has continued to host NDT as an Internet measurement service on our global server platform. Over the past two years, M-Lab developers have been working through the technical debt to migrate our platform to Docker containers, managed by Kubernetes, and concurrently have refactored NDT server, and developed reference clients for various languages and operating systems. The new NDT server is 'Docker-ized' and is based on WebSocket and TLS, uses TCP BBR where it is available, and is backward compatible with previous clients. M-Lab anticipates that. by the end of Q3 2019, all our servers worldwide will be running the new NDT version, managed by Kubernetes.

The M-Lab team is eager to share this work with the R&E network community and offers to contribute this work to the perfSONAR toolkit. This session will demo the new NDT server and reference clients, and we hope to engage with the R&E network community on this exciting development.
