# Getting Involved

M-Lab welcomes the participation of industries, institutions, and researchers who would like to help expand the platform and ensure its growth and success.

If you are a researcher who is interested in deploying tools on M-Lab, or a company or institution interested in providing resources to extend the platform, please read this document outlining [M-Lab's conceptual and technical scope and policies](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B1Z3slE8kdgmYnB0QThkT3RkU0k), as well as [M-Lab's Roles & Responsibilities](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B1Z3slE8kdgmQkczWDMtaktlR00) for new researchers. If your project fits within the guidelines and principles, we invite you to apply for M-Lab hosting below. You can also participate in [our public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss).
